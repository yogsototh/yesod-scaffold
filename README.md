yesod-scaffold
==============

The Yesod scaffolding, with branches for different versions.

If you want to send a pull request affecting all the different flavors, please send it as a pull request against the `postgres` branch. The scripts we use for building the scaffoldings automatically merge changes from `postgres` to all other branches.

If you have a patch which is backend-specific, please send a pull request to the appropriate branch, with a comment that this change applies only to the specific branch.
